# 🧪 Backend Labs

A hands-on collection of backend experiments and technical prototypes built using Java, Spring Boot, and various supporting technologies.

This repository serves as a practical space to:
- Prototype backend features and integrations
- Explore system design patterns and data flows
- Experiment with databases, messaging systems, and external APIs
- Sharpen skills through real-world problem solving

Each lab is self-contained, documented, and focused on a specific backend concept or capability.
