## Overview

**Backend Labs** is a hands-on repository created to prototype backend features, explore systems architecture, and work with key backend technologies. It serves as a practical space to:

- Prototype service interactions and feature behavior
- Explore design patterns, integration flows, and edge cases
- Experiment with databases, messaging systems, and external APIs
- Strengthen engineering fundamentals through applied problem-solving

Each lab is independent, purpose-driven, and self-contained.

---

## Technology Stack

- Java 8+
- Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Redis
- Apache Kafka
- Maven

---

## Repository Structure

Each experiment or concept is organized in a separate subdirectory and includes:

- A focused technical objective
- Independent setup and configuration
- Internal documentation via its own `README.md`

This modular approach ensures clarity and maintainability as the repository grows.
